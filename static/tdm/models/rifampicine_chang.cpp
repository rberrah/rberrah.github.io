# Rifampicin PopPK -- Chang et al. (2015)

# Primary source: Chang MJ et al. Tuberculosis (Edinb). 2015;95:54-59.
# DOI: 10.1016/j.tube.2014.10.013
# South Korea, n=54 adults with pulmonary TB and diabetes mellitus, 450-600 mg
# oral. The equations below were initially transcribed from the Ju et al. model
# repository and still require comparison with the Chang full text.
#
# Structure: one compartment, first-order elimination, transit-compartment
# absorption. What makes it a useful second family is that the covariate model is
# LINEAR rather than allometric-power, and it carries a categorical DIABETES effect
# on both volume and absorption:
#
#   CL = 6.10 + (BMI/20.3) * 6.22
#   Vd = 48.0 + DM * 16.2
#   Ka = 1.31 + DM * 1.56
#
# Structural diversity of this kind is exactly what the leave-one-model-out split
# needs: a model whose functional form differs, not merely its numbers.
#
# The source table reports the absorption as transit-compartment but does not give
# MTT or NN for this study, so plain first-order absorption is used and that
# substitution is recorded here. It is a simplification of the published model.
#
# CAVEAT ON TRANSPORTABILITY: pulmonary-tuberculosis population with diabetes, not a
# bone or prosthetic-joint infection population. Using it for PJI is an
# extrapolation.
#
#
# POPULATION CAVEAT -- READ WITH rifampicine_marsot.cpp
# This model comes from a PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS cohort. The library also contains
# `rifampicine_marsot.cpp`, which is Marsot et al., Br J Clin Pharmacol 2017;83:
# 1039-1047, "Population pharmacokinetics of rifampicin in adult patients with
# OSTEOARTICULAR INFECTIONS: interaction with fusidic acid" -- i.e. the SAFEBONE
# population itself. Marsot is therefore the reference model for bone infection and
# this one is the extrapolation, not the other way round.
#
# Note also that the Ju et al. review used to build this file lists Marsot (2017)
# under "Pulmonary tuberculosis" in its Table 1. That is a mis-annotation: the paper
# is osteoarticular. Provenance metadata taken from that review should be treated
# with corresponding caution.
#
# IIV converted from published %CV by omega^2 = ln(1 + CV^2):
#   CL 53.7% -> 0.2535 | Vd 32.8% -> 0.1022 | Ka 49.9% -> 0.2224

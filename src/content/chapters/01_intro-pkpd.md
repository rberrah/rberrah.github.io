<!-- step:title="PK: what the body does to the drug" slides="s01,s02" viz="01_HumanBody" -->
**What you see**: organs, drug path.
**Why**: PK quantifies Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Elimination (ADME).
**Clinical implication**: pick the right dose to reach the right concentration.
**Pitfall**: confusing slow absorption with low clearance.
<!-- /step -->

<!-- step:title="PD: what the drug does to the body" slides="s03" -->
**What you see**: concentration–effect link.
**Why**: efficacy/toxicity depend on exposure.
**Implication**: measuring concentration alone is insufficient; link it to effect.
**Pitfall**: extrapolating effect without PD delay.
<!-- /step -->

<!-- step:title="Variability" slides="s04,s05" -->
**What you see**: same dose, different responses.
**Why**: IIV (between patients) and IOV (within a patient).
**Implication**: “100 mg for everyone” fails for some.
**Pitfall**: blaming variability only on measurement error.
